## URL Shortener

URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially
shorter and still direct to the required page.

- Long Urls would be given through API and it'd be converted to Short Url and stored in the Table.
- If User enters the same url again, it should be able to give different short url.
- The long URL should also be uniquely identifiable from the short URL.
