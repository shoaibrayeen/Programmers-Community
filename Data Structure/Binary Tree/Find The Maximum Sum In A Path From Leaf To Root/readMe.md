## Given a Binary Tree, find the maximum sum path from a leaf to root. For example, in the following tree, there are three leaf to root paths 8->-2->10, -4->-2->10 and 7->10. The sums of these three paths are 16, 4 and 17 respectively. The maximum of them is 17 and the path for maximum is 7->10.
                  10
               /      \
             -2        7
           /   \     
          8     -4
