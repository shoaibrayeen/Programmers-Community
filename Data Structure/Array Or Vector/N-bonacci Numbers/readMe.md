# You are given two Integers N and M, and print all the terms of the series upto M-terms of the N-bonacci Numbers. For example, when N = 2, the sequence becomes Fibonacci, when n = 3, sequence becomes Tribonacci.

# Constraints
-  1 < size Of Array <= 10^6
-  0 < Array Elements <= 10^9

# Input
- value of N
- value of M

# Output
- return the series

```
Input : N = 3, M = 8
Output : 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13

Input : N = 4, M = 10
Output : 0 0 0 1 1 2 4 8 15 29

 ```
