# Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

# Constraints
- m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- -10^4 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10^4

# Input
- Matrix of size m*n
- target

# Output
- True or False

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3

Output: true
