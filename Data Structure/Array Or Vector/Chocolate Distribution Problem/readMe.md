# Given an array of n integers where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that:

##### 1.Each student gets one packet.
##### 2.The difference between the number of chocolates in packet with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.

# Constraints
-  1 < size Of Array <= 10^6
-  0 < Array Elements <= 10^9

# Input
- Array
- Its Size
- No. of childrens

# Output
- Print the Minimum difference between the m packets

```
Input : arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}
m = 3
Output: 2

Input : arr[] = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12}
