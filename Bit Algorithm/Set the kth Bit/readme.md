#A user inputs a number say 32 , and a position say 7. 
#write a function which takes the number and sets its 7th position counting from least significant digit and then return the resultant number in decimal.

# Example-32’s binary representation is 00100000 and after setting its 7th position from least significant position, 
# the resultant number becomes: 01100000,which is 96.
