### Given a string, a partitioning of the string is a palindrome partitioning if every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

```
For example, “aba|b|bbabb|a|b|aba” is a palindrome partitioning of “ababbbabbababa”. 
Determine the fewest cuts needed for palindrome partitioning of a given string.

For example, minimum 3 cuts are needed for “ababbbabbababa”. 
The three cuts are “a|babbbab|b|ababa”. If a string is palindrome, then minimum 0 cuts are needed. 
If a string of length n containing all different characters, then minimum n-1 cuts are needed.
```
