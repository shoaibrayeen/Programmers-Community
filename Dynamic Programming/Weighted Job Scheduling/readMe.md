### Given N jobs where every job is represented by following three elements of it.

- Start Time
- Finish Time
- Profit or Value Associated

### Find the maximum profit subset of jobs such that no two jobs in the subset overlap.

```
Input: Number of Jobs n = 4
       Job Details {Start Time, Finish Time, Profit}
       Job 1:  {1, 2, 50} 
       Job 2:  {3, 5, 20}
       Job 3:  {6, 19, 100}
       Job 4:  {2, 100, 200}
Output: The maximum profit is 250.
We can get the maximum profit by scheduling jobs 1 and 4.
Note that there is longer schedules possible Jobs 1, 2 and 3 
but the profit with this schedule is 20+50+100 which is less than 250. 
```
